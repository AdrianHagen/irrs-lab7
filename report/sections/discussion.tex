The results demonstrate the high impact of vocabulary pruning on cluster
quality. Initially, using default parameters resulted in
clusters dominated by common terms like ``the'' and ``is.'' By restricting
the maximum frequency to 20\%, we successfully isolated technical vocabularies
that closely align with the original ArXiv folder structure.

However, CLASS0 remained a ``generic'' cluster, containing terms like
``how'' and ``understand.'' This indicates that even with frequency
filtering, some high-frequency research-meta terms persist and can
dilute cluster purity. Regarding performance, the lack of a
linear speed-up when using multiple cores is explained by the overhead
of inter-process communication in a local simulation and the hardware-induced
frequency scaling observed during the mid-iterations.
