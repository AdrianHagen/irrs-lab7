The algorithm was executed for 20 iterations using four parallel processes
(\texttt{--ncores 4}). The final prototypes exhibited clear thematic
specialisation.

The computational performance showed significant variance across iterations.
While the first iteration took 2.88 seconds, subsequent iterations' execution times
steadily increased from 2.88 seconds to a maximum of 11.99 seconds.

This increase is attributed to thermal throttling on the
host hardware, which lacked active cooling and reached temperatures in excess
of 100°C during the workload.

\input{img/time_per_iteration}

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:time_per_iteration}, the execution time per iteration did not follow the
expected pattern of initial overhead followed by stability.
Instead, a sharp increase in running time was observed starting at Iteration 2,
coinciding with the CPU reaching its thermal limit of 100--101°C.
The computation time steadily increases as the primary cooling thermal mass
(laptop's cooling chamber) is saturated, but the secondary thermal mass
(laptop chassis) begins to absorb heat, leading to a further gradual performance
degradation as the CPU increasingly throttles further to manage temperature.
