This laboratory successfully implemented a scalable K-means clustering solution
using MapReduce. We conclude that the choice of vocabulary---specifically
the exclusion of high-frequency terms---is the most critical factor in achieving
interpretable document clusters. Despite hardware limitations
causing thermal throttling, the system effectively categorised over 58,000
documents into meaningful scientific domains. Future work could involve
implementing TF-IDF weighting within the MapReduce steps to further reduce
the influence of generic research terminology.
