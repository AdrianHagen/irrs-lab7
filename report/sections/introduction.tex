This report details the implementation and evaluation of a document
clustering system using the K-means algorithm within the MapReduce framework.
The primary objective was to categorise a subset of the ArXiv dataset into
eight distinct scientific domains based on textual similarity.
Using the \texttt{mrjob} Python library, we simulated a distributed environment
to handle the computational intensity of iterative clustering.
The laboratory explores the critical relationship between vocabulary selection,
distance metrics(Jaccard similarity) and the overall efficiency
of parallel processing in a MapReduce architecture.
